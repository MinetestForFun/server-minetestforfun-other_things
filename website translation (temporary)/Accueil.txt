What is Minetest ?


Minetest is a game created by celeron55, similar to Infiniminer/Minecraft. The survival mode and the other singleplayer or multiplayer modes are, of course, part of it.

The game is still in developpement, but already in a stable release since 0.4.5. Actually at the 0.4.13 release, the game is nicely working and playable on Windows, Linux and Macintosh. It's very similar to Minecraft if you except some little details.
